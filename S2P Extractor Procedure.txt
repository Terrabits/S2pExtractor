S2P Extractor Procedure
- Set data
- isReady, if not error
- load calibrations used (inner, outer)
- Test for switch matrix
- Find calibrated ports
- Create ports left list
- Query frequencies used
- Get VNA ports... Something about Test port -> physical VNA port -> Switch matrix port
- While ports left list has ports:
  * isPort1, Port2 matrix?
  * logicalPort1/2, physicalPort1/2
  * Get next port pair via portPair(..)
  *   if is error, return error
  * calculate s2p
  *   if is error, return error


Major parts to separate into smaller, testable parts:
- PortMap class
  * Given logical port number
  * returns: physical port, is switch matrix
- PortPairs class
  * Given: selected logical ports
  * returns: PortMap pairs
- CorrectionData class - returns frequencies, corrections
- CalculateCorrections(CorrectionData &inner, CorrectionData &outer)
  * Network <= firstS2pFile
  * Network <= secondS2pFile

Any assumptions I can make?
- Only one switch matrix
- Only one calibration (?)
- Frequencies are the same
- Ports are the same
- Calibration types match

How to find corrections?
- Specify port 1
- If applicable, specify port 2
- Try different physical port combinations until you find corrections
- Return corrections tied to logical port
Need:
- Corrections instance (VnaCorrections)
- Port 1
- Maybe Port 2
- If port 1, must have corrections for port 1
- If port 2, must have corrections for port 2
